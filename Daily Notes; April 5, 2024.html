<p>I find it funny that it keeps calling it <i>not</i> a snapshot despite that being exactly what it is. It also downplayed some really strongly negative things I wrote, but eh, that's okay. What it describes about my usage of Obsidian <i>might</i> be accurate, but it was making that up, because the context provided doesn't show that.</p>
<p>The suicidal MTG desk was inspired by Magic The Noah's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAD0acxNHTQ">I Made A Magic Deck That Doesn't Play Magic</a> video. It was a very fun way to introduce myself to playing MTG, and meeting other players. I also find it funny that it highlights spending $12 on specific things and ignores that I spent $60 in total, despite that being highlighted in the source.</p>
<p>The daily questions bit gives "examples" that are the only things shown. (I used a template to randomly choose from a massive list, but it doesn't see this context, and hallucinates that there are other questions. :D)</p>
<p>The finances talk is <i>wild</i>. The Amazon thing is that they kept withholding pocket change when a refund was issued. (Just because it's a small amount of money doesn't mean it's okay for them to get away with it. A penny to you is millions to a company when they do it to <i>everyone</i>.)</p>
<p>It also highlights the built-in bias that it assumes Marx would focus on <i>individualism</i> in any form when his works were about collectivism (and how individualism hurts us all).</p>
