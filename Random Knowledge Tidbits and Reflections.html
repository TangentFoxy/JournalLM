<p>The Monster Group <i>is</i> a "found" thing. I have no idea why it included the phrase "Good soldiers follow orders." in relation to how medical companies are a collective fuck-up. :D I feel mildly disgusted by its blind acceptance that following orders is good. There is extremely important context completely ignored - because it wasn't specifically in my notes.</p>
<p>Nothing about building a personal ethical code in there, and also by choosing to include the word <i>personal</i>, it reveals that it doesn't know what ethics <i>are</i>. It also seems to imply that I think having money is an aspirational goal? It claims "money is power" is a good thing instead on its own accord, which is bad.</p>
<p>I think a consistent problem with these generations is the assumption of individual power, which isn't real. The "closing thoughts" are particularly disgusting because it squarely puts the blame for problems on individuals rather than the structures responsible for the mess we're in.</p>
