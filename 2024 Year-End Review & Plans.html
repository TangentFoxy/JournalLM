<p><b>NotebookLM Summary</b>: These journal entries from November 2023 and January 2024 document the author's daily life, including media consumption (YouTube videos and a film), personal projects (creating custom Magic: The Gathering cards and a technology dependency chart), and self-improvement goals (tracking steps and writing weekly, monthly, and yearly reviews). The entries reveal struggles with maintaining a consistent review schedule and lapses in self-care, along with plans for future tasks and technology-related projects within a Minecraft world. The author also notes missing information and expresses concern about several self-care tasks. The entries show a blend of personal reflections and practical to-do lists.</p>

<p>The randomly chosen journal entries for this episode are from the beginning of 2024 and earlier, so it's <i>wild</i> that it chose to label it as an <i>end</i> of 2024 summary. I find it funny that it calls me stating that RescueTime wasn't capturing everything as "questioning" if everything was captured, and then recommends it as a 3rd-party app for time tracking, when my notes included a rant about how Apple broke it and all 3rd-party time-tracking systems. You can't time-track in iOS anymore. Even using Shortcuts to jury-rig a time-tracker doesn't really work. I also find it funny how it pretends to know about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZFipeZtQM5CKUjx6grh54g/videos">Isaac Arthur's YouTube channel</a> even though it lacks any context for that, and claims I have a realistic goal to write notes on all of his videos when the note was about how my goal <i>is not realistic</i>.</p>
<p>It actually captures the notes about autism fairly well at first, but then ascribes some comments to me that were quoted from someone else.</p>
