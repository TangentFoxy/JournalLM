<p>Random journals + NotebookLM "podcasts" = this slop.</p>

<p>Throw <a href="https://tangentfoxy.github.io/JournalLM/podcast.xml">this URL</a> into a podcast player, and <strike>rejoice</strike> regret. This shit <a href="https://github.com/TangentFoxy/JournalLM/">on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I decided to see what NotebookLM's podcasts feature would do when presented with 3 randomly chosen journal entries from 499 digitized entries spanning from 2011 to early November 2024. It was entertaining enough to share the results, and add some notes on it. (Most of the source entries are from 2022 and 2023, with barely any notes existing from before 2019.)</p>
<p>On this page are only the NotebookLM summaries, but each "episode page" has additional notes I've added to it.</p>

<p><b>NotebookLM Summary</b>: These journal entries from November 2023 and January 2024 document the author's daily life, including media consumption (YouTube videos and a film), personal projects (creating custom Magic: The Gathering cards and a technology dependency chart), and self-improvement goals (tracking steps and writing weekly, monthly, and yearly reviews). The entries reveal struggles with maintaining a consistent review schedule and lapses in self-care, along with plans for future tasks and technology-related projects within a Minecraft world. The author also notes missing information and expresses concern about several self-care tasks. The entries show a blend of personal reflections and practical to-do lists.</p>
