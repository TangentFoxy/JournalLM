<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: Relate everything to oranges or the color orange.</p>

<p><strong>NotebookLM Summary</strong>:</p>

<p>(It failed to generate one this time. I don't see any options to tell it to try again after the initial load.)</p>

<p><strong>My Response</strong>: I initially tried without a silly prompt, but it was <em>sooo</em> misleading, boring, and long.</p>

<p>The "Prius aircraft" bit is referencing a video. Unfortunately, its creator decided to delete it, so I can't link to it. The "video about sinkholes" idea is <em>not</em> a video about sinkholes..</p>

<p><b>Edit</b>: I should've included the prompt used to generate the episode art: "Journaling LM podcast focused on oranges."</p>
