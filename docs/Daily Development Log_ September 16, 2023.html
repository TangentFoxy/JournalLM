<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: Introduce your podcast as "JournalLM". This is essential. The intro is very important. You also have an editor removing all ums and uhs, so they shouldn't be in the output. Make sure you conclude with a short story about hybrid vehicles in racing.</p>

<p><strong>NotebookLM Summary</strong>: This journal entry documents the author's progress on several projects. A datapack for the game ComputerCraft was successfully created, based on existing modifications. The author also notes ongoing work editing and tagging NSFW furry artwork, referencing specific artists. Finally, the author considers developing a random Minecraft build idea generator, ultimately deciding against rigid categorization for now.</p>

<p><strong>My Response</strong>: <br>
ðŸŽ‰ I can't believe it actually follow the introduction instruction! ðŸŽ‰</p>

<ul>
    <li>Resale value is a stupid metric to consider when buying a vehicle, because you should <em>use</em> the vehicle, not try to make a profit off of it.</li>
    <li>The video mentioned is <em>actually</em> titled <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=DbsAQSIKQXk">Hack your brain with Obsidian.md</a> by No Boilerplate.</li>
    <li>The "respect their privacy" bit is talking about organizing smut.</li>
</ul>
