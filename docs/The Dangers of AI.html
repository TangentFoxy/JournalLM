<p><strong>NotebookLM Summary</strong>: These journal entries document the author's experiences with Obsidian, a note-taking application. The entries detail troubleshooting synchronization issues across multiple devices (desktop, iPhone, iPad), including problems with plugins and automatic syncing. The author also reflects on content creation plans, such as a YouTube video, and mentions reading and Minecraft gameplay. Furthermore, concerns about data security related to GitHub syncing are expressed, along with plans for improved note-taking on specific topics. Finally, the author consistently tracks daily tasks and plans in their journal.</p>

<p><strong>My Response</strong>: I love how it ascribes motivation/desire to simple thoughts. The issue with using GitHub is that if you use any copyrighted materials, even if you own them and only have them in private repos, they can and will destroy your account with no compensation. On top of that, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE0EB5bXj14">algorithm-driven decisionmaking ruins lives</a>.</p>

<p>I haven't read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56769575-stiff"><em>Stiff</em> by Mary Roach</a>, but it's happy to claim I have. It's fucking weird and wrong how it describes "searching for a balance" between privacy and control.. there is no balance. <strong>Privacy is being violated and that's not okay.</strong></p>

<p>It makes up content about dangers of AI, when all I had written was that I needed to collate a note about it. It's also completely missing the mark, because it talks of that as a background anxiety and how "we're in uncharted waters" when the problem is that most issues are well understood <em>but ignored</em>. I want to have better notes on it so that I can better explain that to others.</p>

<p>Ah yes, nothing says learning quite like being unable to use a tool you know how to use..</p>

<p>..It's not about how you use tools, it's about corporations ruining things..</p>
