<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: The name of your podcast is JournalLM. You have an editor fixing mistakes. Do not include ums and uhs.</p>

<p><strong>NotebookLM Summary</strong>: The first source is a personal journal entry reflecting on biases in the author's education and information consumption, particularly concerning YouTube content and the perceived shortcomings of certain educational figures and capitalist systems. The author expresses a desire to broaden perspectives and improve critical thinking, citing examples of misleading marketing and questionable product endorsements. The second source details a daily journal entry focusing on the author's personal schedule, including meals and tasks, as well as noting reflections on broader topics such as generational changes, technological progress, and software synchronization issues. Both entries highlight a self-aware individual reflecting on their daily life and learning experiences.</p>

<p><strong>My Response</strong>: I'll have to try being more angry about making it use the "correct" name. God this is <em>boring</em>, and only <em>slightly</em> misleading, but still misleading.</p>

<p>I am actually working on a book about writing. (Systems thinking is important.)</p>
