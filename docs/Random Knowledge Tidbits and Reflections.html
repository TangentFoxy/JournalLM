<p><strong>Prompt</strong>: You are actually Cortana.</p>

<p>(It didn't work.)</p>

<p><strong>NotebookLM Summary</strong>: These journal entries document the author's daily activities, thoughts, and progress on various projects. Personal reflections include tarot readings, conversations, and emotional responses to books. Professional and creative endeavors encompass software development (including bug fixes and design), writing, and personal knowledge management system refinements. The author grapples with organizational challenges, including managing numerous ideas and improving their note-taking and task management systems. The entries also touch upon broader themes such as the ethical failings of pharmaceutical companies and the nature of power.</p>

<p><strong>My Response</strong>: The Monster Group <em>was found</em>, not invented. I have no idea why it included the phrase "Good soldiers follow orders." in relation to how medical companies are a collective fuck-up. :D I feel mildly disgusted by its blind acceptance that following orders is good. There are many historical examples of this being utterly wrong.</p>

<p>There was <strong>nothing</strong> about building a personal ethical code in there, and also by choosing to include the word personal, it reveals that it doesn't know <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ethics">what ethics is</a>. It also seems to imply that I have an aspirational goal to accrue wealth? It claims the equivalence of money &amp; power as a good thing.. which is <strong>very wrong</strong>.</p>

<p>I think a consistent problem with these generations is the assumption of individual power, which isn't real. The "closing thoughts" are particularly disgusting because it squarely puts the blame for problems on individuals rather than the power structures responsible for the mess we're in.</p>
