**Prompt**: Relate everything to oranges or the color orange.

**NotebookLM Summary**:

(It failed to generate one this time. I don't see any options to tell it to try again after the initial load.)

**My Response**: I initially tried without a silly prompt, but it was *sooo* misleading, boring, and long.

The "Prius aircraft" bit is referencing a video. Unfortunately, its creator decided to delete it, so I can't link to it. The "video about sinkholes" idea is *not* a video about sinkholes..

**Edit**: I should've included the prompt used to generate the episode art: "Journaling LM podcast focused on oranges."
