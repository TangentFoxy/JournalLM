**Prompt**: Introduce your podcast as "JournalLM". This is essential. The intro is very important. You also have an editor removing all ums and uhs, so they shouldn't be in the output. Do not glaze the notetaker. Be critical, not effusive.

**NotebookLM Summary**:

(It didn't even try to generate one this time. Maybe they stopped doing that?)

**My Response**: *Really* annoyed that it ignored the instruction that previously worked. Seems that it decided to be *more* effusive instead of less.

**Do not buy Parallels.** They scammed me by lying about license details and then refusing to refund or correct the problem.

The video mentioned was highlighted with the wrong title, as well as context around that. The real video is [God's Alternative Medicine | Christian Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7RT4wNhiYQ) by Knowing Better. The statements about Christian Scientists infecting the Merriam Webster dictionary and constantly murdering children *are* accurate, sadly.

The notes on phone battery life are because an update was pushed that completely ruined the device, and T-Mobile and LG both refused to acknowledge culpability. The mention of Motorolla is because that was *the device I was taking notes on*, not the device that had problems.

Preventing you from installing an OS on a phone really should be illegal. It's fucked up that they can just *stop* that.

- [Moonfall (2022 film)](https://moonfall.movie/) is a fun movie, despite some *really stupid* aspects.

**Image Prompt**: first-person visual exploration of the fictional Feltyrion galaxy
