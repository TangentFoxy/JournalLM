# JournalLM
I can't believe I'm doing this. Random journals + NotebookLM "podcasts" = this slop.

This is using a podcast publishing tool I made:

Reminding myself of some of the dumb tools I've used:
- https://notebooklm.google.com/
- https://perchance.org/ai-photo-generator
- https://www.fakenamegenerator.com

I've also used Audacity, Mp3tag, GIMP, Pulsar..
