# JournalLM
I can't believe I'm doing this. Random journals + NotebookLM "podcasts" = this slop.

This is using a podcast publishing tool I made:
https://github.com/TangentFoxy/github.io-podcasts/

Reminding myself of some of the dumb tools I've used:
- https://notebooklm.google.com/
- https://perchance.org/ai-photo-generator
- https://www.fakenamegenerator.com

I've also used Audacity, Mp3tag, GIMP, Pulsar..

Reminding myself: `secret-journal` is the ignored directory where I put
everything, and `upload` is the ignored directory where 3 items will be randomly
pulled. (I do this to make sure I censor anything I need to for personal safety
before uploading.)
