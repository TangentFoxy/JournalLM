# JournalLM
I can't believe I'm doing this. Random journals + NotebookLM "podcasts" = this slop.

The reason there are several semi-duplicated files is that I was trying to work around a bug in PocketCasts.  
`feed13.xml` is the current feed. `podcast-image.jpg` is the current thumbnail/cover/whatever.

Reminding myself of some of the dumb tools I've used:
- https://notebooklm.google.com/
- https://www.urlencoder.org
- https://perchance.org/ai-photo-generator

I've also used Audacity, Mp3tag, GIMP, Pulsar..
